# Marlin-2.0.x-for-Tevo-v1
 Here the file I found works best on the Tevo v1 That works without modivications to the standard setup


 Take note that I only changed (#define CHANGE_Y_DIRECTION) to be true on line 39 of the configuration.h file found in the Marlin folder.


 I recommend always doing a PID test upon what invirement your printer is in on both the HotEnd and the HotBed. this can be done with PronterFace. This is a great idea when having done the upgrade to a 24v power supply! We don't want fire now, do we? jk Xd


The file can be compiled in Visual Studio Code with the extentions PlatformIO IDE and Auto Build Marlin. For a quick search on youtube: How to upload marlin firmware through vscode.
